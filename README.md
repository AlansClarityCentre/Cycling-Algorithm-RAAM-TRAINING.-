Algorithm helps track cycling rides.

AIMS: Store data, synthesise graphs for descriptive data, highlight trends, acts as a training log with qualitative data aswell. 

Factors in cycling rides considered: 

QUANTITATIVE DATA

temperature 
wind 
diet 
pace (km/h or MPH) 
calories burnt (estimated by an app) 
distance 
start and end time (date) 
duration of ride 
breaks in ride 
sleep 
heart rate 
elevation 
ride type (training, rest, test ride (longest distances) ). 
calorie intake (seperate daily log and ride log). 
road quality 

OTHER PIECES OF GARMIN DATA, E.G CADENCE. 


QUALITATIVE DATA 

percieved exertion 
comfort (knee pain or neck pain) /10.
reasons of performance (e.g sickness, supplements taken to improve perofrmance). 
post workout soreness (seperate log).
weather type (raining, windy, etc). 

OTHER DESIGNS (not code focused, rather user interface). 
Design of personal algorithm/app. 
graph 
step by step pop up (e.g 1. ride type, 2. distance 3, time and so on). 

ALL FEATURES: 
DATA TRACK 
RIDE RATINGS
ROUTE PREFERENCES 
GRAPH 
POP UPS 
LOGS 
EVERYTHING CAN BE RE-EDITED/CORRECT LATER 
TREND LOGS (e.g speed and disrance increase by %) 

NOTE TO SELF (creator): This could be a possible app for all atheletes to use if executed well. 

EXTENSION TASKS (if main is done well and quickly): 
reminder system 
progress flightpath + maybe customisable flightpath.
